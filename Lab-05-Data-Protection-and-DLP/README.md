# Lab 05 – Data Protection and Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

## Objective
Implement Zero Trust data protection controls by classifying sensitive data, enforcing data loss prevention (DLP) policies, and monitoring data access and usage across the environment.

This lab ensures that **data remains protected regardless of user, device, or location**.

---

## Zero Trust Principle
- Verify explicitly
- Use least privilege access
- Assume breach

Data protection is enforced continuously, even after access is granted.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Microsoft Purview
- Sensitivity labels
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies
- Microsoft Entra ID
- Audit and compliance monitoring

---

## Data Classification
- Identified sensitive data types
- Applied sensitivity labels to data
- Enforced protection rules based on classification

---

## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Created DLP policies to prevent unauthorized data sharing
- Monitored data movement across applications and endpoints
- Blocked or restricted risky data actions

---

## Continuous Monitoring
- Logged data access and usage events
- Audited policy enforcement actions
- Reviewed alerts for potential data exposure

---

## Validation
- Confirmed DLP policies triggered correctly
- Verified protected data could not be exfiltrated
- Tested policy behavior across applications

---

## Outcome
This lab demonstrates the ability to:
- Protect sensitive data using Zero Trust principles
- Enforce data-centric security controls
- Monitor and respond to data risk

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data classification
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Microsoft Purview
- Compliance and audit logging
- Zero Trust data security

---

## Notes
Screenshots and validation evidence will be added after all lab documentation is complete.
