# Lab 04 – Application Access and Authentication

## Objective
Implement Zero Trust application access controls by securing applications with modern authentication, identity-based access policies, and least privilege principles.

This lab focuses on removing implicit trust from application access and enforcing authentication and authorization before access is granted.

---

## Zero Trust Principle
- Verify explicitly
- Use least privilege access
- Assume breach

This lab demonstrates that **applications are protected independently of the network**.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Microsoft Entra ID
- Conditional Access policies
- OAuth 2.0 / Modern authentication
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
- Least privilege access controls

---

## Application Security Overview
- Applications protected using identity-aware controls
- Access evaluated before application access is granted
- Policies enforce authentication strength and user context

---

## Modern Authentication
- Enforced modern authentication methods
- Removed legacy authentication where applicable
- Ensured secure token-based authentication flows

---

## Conditional Access for Applications
- Required user authentication before app access
- Evaluated:
  - User identity
  - Sign-in risk
  - Authentication strength
- Blocked access when conditions were not met

---

## Least Privilege Application Access
- Limited access to only required users
- Prevented over-permissioned application access
- Reduced application attack surface

---

## Validation
- Verified access enforcement using Conditional Access
- Confirmed blocked access for non-compliant sign-ins
- Tested authentication flows for protected applications

---

## Outcome
This lab demonstrates the ability to:
- Secure application access using Zero Trust principles
- Enforce authentication before authorization
- Protect cloud applications using identity-aware controls

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Application access control
- Conditional Access policy design
- Modern authentication concepts
- Least privilege enforcement
- Cloud application security

---

## Notes
Screenshots and validation evidence will be added after all lab documentation is complete.
